## MODULE 1: FOUNDATIONS OF SELF-SEEING

### Activity 1: Your Visual Autobiography

**Theory:**
Your life story can be told through images. What you've photographed (or wish you'd photographed) reveals your values, interests, loves, and losses. Creating visual autobiography makes your story visible.

**Exercise:**
1. Gather existing photos from your life (childhood to now)
2. Select 20 that feel most significant
3. Arrange chronologically or thematically
4. For each, write one sentence: "This image matters because..."
5. Notice patterns: What themes appear? What's absent?

**Reflection Questions:**
- What story do these images tell?
- Who's missing? Why?
- If you could add 5 images to complete your story, what would you photograph?
- What does your visual history reveal about you?

**Going Deeper:**
Create new photographs to fill gaps in your story. Document what you've never documented before.

---

### Activity 2: Your First Photographic Memory

**Theory:**
The first photograph you remember seeing tells you something about your visual formation. Why did that image stick? What did it awaken in you?

**Exercise:**
1. Recall the first photograph you remember clearly seeing
2. Describe it in detail (write or draw it)
3. When/where did you see it? How old were you?
4. What feelings did it evoke?
5. How has it influenced your seeing?
6. If possible, find that image again
7. Create a response photograph—your answer to that first image

**Reflection Questions:**
- Why do you think you remember this specific image?
- What did it teach you about photography?
- How has your first photographic memory shaped your practice?

**Going Deeper:**
Interview family members about early photos. What images shaped your family's visual culture?

---

### Activity 3: What Draws Your Eye

**Theory:**
You don't photograph randomly. Certain subjects, colors, patterns consistently attract you. These preferences reveal your inner world. Noticing what draws you teaches you about yourself.

**Exercise:**
1. For one week, photograph anything that catches your eye (50+ images)
2. Don't analyze—just shoot what attracts you
3. At week's end, review all images
4. Sort into categories (subjects, colors, moods, themes)
5. What patterns emerge?
6. What are you drawn to repeatedly?

**Reflection Questions:**
- Are you attracted to light or shadow? Color or monochrome?
- People or places? Movement or stillness?
- What does your attraction pattern reveal?
- What surprises you about what draws you?

**Going Deeper:**
Choose your most common attraction (e.g., "windows") and create 20-image series exploring only that. Go deep into one attraction.

---

### Activity 4: Your Photography Values

**Theory:**
Every photographer has implicit values—what they believe photography should be/do. Making values explicit helps you create more authentic work aligned with what matters to you.

**Exercise:**
1. Complete these sentences:
   - "Good photography should..."
   - "Photography is most powerful when..."
   - "I photograph because..."
   - "Through photography, I want to..."
   - "Photography helps me..."

2. From these, extract your core photography values
3. Rank them in importance
4. Check: Does your current work align with these values?

**Reflection Questions:**
- Where did these values come from?
- Are they truly yours or inherited?
- Which values guide your best work?
- What would change if you lived your values more fully?

**Going Deeper:**
Create mission statement: "My photography exists to [purpose]. I photograph [subjects] because [reason]. I want viewers to [response]."

---

### Activity 5: Photographic Projection

**Theory:**
Psychological projection means seeing your inner world in outer subjects. You don't just photograph trees—you photograph your relationship with nature, your feelings about growth/decay, your need for grounding. Every photograph is self-portrait.

**Exercise:**
1. Choose 10 of your favorite photographs you've made
2. For each, ask: "What am I really photographing here?"
3. Look beyond subject to subject matter
4. Example: "I photographed abandoned building" → "I'm photographing loneliness/nostalgia/decay/my own feelings of abandonment"
5. Notice which emotions/themes appear repeatedly

**Reflection Questions:**
- What do your photographs reveal about your inner state?
- Which emotions appear most in your work?
- What are you working through photographically?
- How has your inner world changed your seeing?

**Going Deeper:**
Consciously photograph your current emotional state. Make the invisible visible.

---

### Activity 6: Your Photographic Influences

**Theory:**
No artist creates in vacuum. Your influences shape your seeing. Understanding who influences you helps you distinguish borrowed vision from authentic vision.

**Exercise:**
1. List 5 photographers whose work moves you
2. For each, write: What specifically do I admire?
3. Find one image from each that you wish you'd made
4. Analyze: What does my collection of influences reveal?
5. Create one photograph deliberately combining all 5 influences
6. Then create one that's purely you, rejecting all influences

**Reflection Questions:**
- Do your influences share common traits?
- Are you too influenced by others?
- Where is your unique voice beyond influences?
- Who do you influence?

**Going Deeper:**
Study one photographer deeply for one month. Immerse, then emerge. What did you learn? What did you reject?

---

## MODULE 2: THE BODY AND PRESENCE

### Activity 7: Your Body, Your Camera

**Theory:**
Your body is your first camera—eyes see, hands hold, feet move you into position. Before learning technical camera skills, understand your embodied seeing. How does your body photograph?

**Exercise:**
1. Photograph for one hour without looking through viewfinder
2. Point camera intuitively, trust your body's sense of space
3. Notice: Where does your body naturally position itself?
4. Do you crouch low? Stand back? Get close?
5. Review images: What did body-knowing capture?

**Reflection Questions:**
- How does your body move when photographing?
- Do you make yourself small or take up space?
- What's your natural distance from subjects?
- How would you photograph differently in different body?

**Going Deeper:**
Create body-position series: All low angles, all high angles, all at arm's length. See how body position shapes vision.

---

### Activity 8: Five Senses Photography

**Theory:**
Photography is visual medium but other senses inform seeing. Synesthesia in photography means translating smell, taste, touch, sound into visual images.

**Exercise:**
For each sense, create 3 images:

**Taste:** Photograph bitter, sweet, umami
**Touch:** Photograph rough, smooth, soft
**Smell:** Photograph fragrant, acrid, neutral
**Sound:** Photograph loud, whisper, silence
**Sight:** Photograph as you normally would

Compare: Does bringing in other senses change your visual work?

**Reflection Questions:**
- Which sense (beyond sight) most influences your photography?
- Can viewers "feel" or "hear" your images?
- How do you translate non-visual experience visually?

**Going Deeper:**
Create photograph you can almost taste/smell/hear/touch. Make image multi-sensory.

---

### Activity 9: Photographing Your Daily Rituals

**Theory:**
Rituals structure life—morning coffee, evening walk, bedtime routine. Photographing rituals makes visible how you spend time and what grounds you. Rituals reveal values.

**Exercise:**
1. List your daily rituals (small and large)
2. Choose 5 most meaningful
3. Photograph each ritual—not just activity but feeling of it
4. Create series: "How I Spend My Days"
5. Notice: Are these rituals nourishing? Numbing? Necessary?

**Reflection Questions:**
- What rituals serve you? Which don't?
- How do your rituals reflect your values?
- What's missing from your rituals?
- If days become life, what life are these days creating?

**Going Deeper:**
Create new ritual and photograph it. Document ritual's transformation over time.

---

### Activity 10: Your Hands

**Theory:**
Hands are instruments of creation. Your hands make photographs—hold camera, press shutter, edit images. But hands also reveal history, work, touch, age. Hand portraits are intimate self-portraits.

**Exercise:**
1. Photograph your hands 20 ways:
   - At rest
   - Working
   - Holding something meaningful
   - Open (giving)
   - Closed (holding)
   - With another's hands
   - As landscape (macro, abstract)
   - Aged or marked
   - In motion
   - In relation to your camera

**Reflection Questions:**
- What do your hands tell about your life?
- What have your hands created/destroyed?
- How do you feel about your hands?
- What do you need to hold? Let go of?

**Going Deeper:**
Create hand series with people who matter—comparing hands, connecting hands, your hands with theirs.

---

### Activity 11: Where You Live

**Theory:**
Environment shapes identity. Your home reflects inner world—what you value, need, fear, love. Photographing your space reveals how you live and what matters to you.

**Exercise:**
1. Document every room in your home (don't clean first!)
2. Photograph:
   - Where you feel safest
   - Where you create
   - Where you rest
   - What you display (what you want seen)
   - What you hide (what you don't want seen)
3. Create honest portrait of your habitat

**Reflection Questions:**
- Does your space reflect who you are?
- What would stranger learn about you from these images?
- What's missing from your space?
- How does your environment support or limit you?

**Going Deeper:**
Compare your space to childhood home. What patterns continue? What did you change?

---

### Activity 12: Your Relationship with Time

**Theory:**
Everyone relates to time differently—some rush, some savor, some feel time slipping away. Photography freezes time but also reveals your temporal relationship. How do you experience duration?

**Exercise:**
Create three time-based series:

**Fast:** 100 images in 10 minutes (1 every 6 seconds)
**Medium:** 10 images in 1 hour (1 every 6 minutes)  
**Slow:** 1 image over 1 day (24 hours with one subject)

Compare: Which feels most natural? Most difficult? Most revealing?

**Reflection Questions:**
- Do you rush through life or savor it?
- Can you be present with duration?
- How does pace affect your seeing?
- What's your natural rhythm?

**Going Deeper:**
Document one complete day chronologically—image every hour. See your time made visible.

---

## MODULE 3: RELATIONSHIPS AND REFLECTION

### Activity 13: Photographing Love

**Theory:**
Love takes many forms—romantic, familial, friendship, self-love, love of place/activity/idea. Photographing what you love makes love visible and strengthens it through attention.

**Exercise:**
1. List 10 things/people you genuinely love
2. Choose 5 to photograph
3. For each, create image that shows not just subject but your love for it
4. Question: How do you show love through photograph?

**Reflection Questions:**
- Is love visible in your images?
- Do you photograph what you love or what you think you should?
- What loves are missing from your photography?
- How does photographing something change your love for it?

**Going Deeper:**
Create love letter in photographs—series to someone/something you love, showing why/how you love.

---

### Activity 14: The Family Album

**Theory:**
Family photographs shape identity—they tell you who you are, where you come from, who matters. Examining family album reveals family narrative and your place in it.

**Exercise:**
1. Gather family photographs (yours or relatives')
2. Notice: Who's photographed most? Least? Never?
3. What stories do these images tell?
4. What's missing from family narrative?
5. Who controlled camera/narrative?
6. Create response images filling gaps

**Reflection Questions:**
- How did family photography shape your identity?
- What family stories need retelling?
- How do you photograph family differently than previous generations?
- What will your photographic legacy be?

**Going Deeper:**
Interview family members about specific photographs. Record oral histories alongside images.

---

### Activity 15: Significant Others

**Theory:**
Intimate relationships are mirrors—others reflect you back to yourself. Photographing significant others reveals your relational patterns and what you need from connection.

**Exercise:**
1. With consent, photograph someone close to you
2. Create 10 images showing your relationship (not just them)
3. What does series reveal about connection between you?
4. Show them images—what do they see?
5. Let them photograph you—what do they see?

**Reflection Questions:**
- How do you see this person?
- How do they see you?
- What does your photographic relationship reveal?
- What's present? What's missing?

**Going Deeper:**
Exchange photographs with significant other. Compare visions. Where do they match? Differ?

---

### Activity 16: Your Relationship with Nature

**Theory:**
Your nature photography reveals environmental values and your place in natural world. Do you photograph nature as separate (wilderness) or connected (home)? As resource or as sacred?

**Exercise:**
1. Photograph natural subjects for one week
2. Notice your approach:
   - Do you enter nature or observe from outside?
   - Do you photograph "pristine" nature or human-affected?
   - Are you included in images or absent?
   - Do you photograph nature for itself or as symbol?

**Reflection Questions:**
- How do you relate to natural world?
- Are you part of nature or separate?
- What does your nature photography reveal about your environmental values?
- How has nature shaped you?

**Going Deeper:**
Create "portrait with nature"—not portrait in nature, but showing your relationship with natural world.

---

### Activity 17: Self-Portrait Through Objects

**Theory:**
Objects carry meaning. What you own, use, value—these things represent you. Photographing your objects is indirect self-portrait.

**Exercise:**
1. Choose 10 objects that represent different aspects of you
2. Photograph each one beautifully
3. Arrange into self-portrait: "This is who I am, shown through things"
4. Notice: Are these objects you want to define you?

**Reflection Questions:**
- Do your possessions reflect your values?
- What objects would you save in fire?
- What do you want to let go of?
- If someone found only your objects, what would they know about you?

**Going Deeper:**
Create "anti-self-portrait"—photograph objects that DON'T represent you. Who aren't you?

---

### Activity 18: Photographing Absence

**Theory:**
What's missing matters. Loss, absence, what's no longer here—these shape us as much as what's present. Photography can show absence through implication, empty space, memory.

**Exercise:**
1. Think of someone/something absent from your life
2. How do you photograph absence?
3. Options:
   - Empty chair
   - Their belongings
   - Place they loved
   - Your response to absence
4. Create series about loss without showing what's lost

**Reflection Questions:**
- What absences shape your life?
- How do you carry loss?
- Can photography witness grief?
- What needs to be mourned photographically?

**Going Deeper:**
Create memorial series. Honor what's gone through photographic witness.

---

## MODULE 4: SHADOW WORK AND TRANSFORMATION

### Activity 19: What You Avoid Photographing

**Theory:**
What you won't photograph reveals fear, judgment, discomfort. Shadow work means facing what you avoid. Photographing the avoided can be liberating.

**Exercise:**
1. List 5 things you've never photographed (and why not)
2. Examples: Your aging, poverty, sexuality, anger, body parts you don't like, certain people, etc.
3. Choose one avoided subject
4. Photograph it carefully, respectfully, honestly
5. Notice what happens when you face avoidance

**Reflection Questions:**
- Why have you avoided these subjects?
- What would change if you stopped avoiding?
- Whose voice tells you not to photograph this?
- What happens when you photograph the forbidden?

**Going Deeper:**
Create series of previously avoided subjects. Document your shadow material.

---

### Activity 20: Before and After

**Theory:**
Transformation requires acknowledging where you've been. Before/after photography documents change—external or internal. Seeing change helps you understand growth.

**Exercise:**
1. Choose area of life where you've changed significantly
2. Options: Physical space, body, relationship, habit, belief
3. If possible, find "before" image
4. Create "after" image now
5. Make side-by-side comparison
6. Write: How did this change happen? Was it chosen or forced? What did it cost/give you?

**Reflection Questions:**
- What transformation are you proudest of?
- What transformation was hardest?
- What still needs to transform?
- How does photography document inner change?

**Going Deeper:**
Create "during" series—document ongoing transformation, not just before/after but middle.

---

### Activity 21: What You Judge

**Theory:**
Judgment reveals values and fears. What you judge in others often reflects what you reject in yourself (shadow projection). Photographing what you judge can soften judgment and reveal hidden parts of self.

**Exercise:**
1. Notice what you judge when looking at world
2. Examples: People who do X, places that look Y, behaviors you condemn
3. Choose one judgment
4. Photograph the judged subject/behavior compassionately
5. Try to see what you've judged with kindness
6. Notice: Does photography shift judgment?

**Reflection Questions:**
- What do you judge most harshly?
- Does this judgment protect you from something?
- Can you see your judged subjects humanly?
- Where might you be similar to what you judge?

**Going Deeper:**
Create self-portrait showing your own judged qualities. Can you show yourself compassionately doing/being what you judge?

---

### Activity 22: Your Fears

**Theory:**
Fear limits vision. What you fear determines what you don't see or won't photograph. Photographing fears (carefully, safely) can reduce their power and expand your vision.

**Exercise:**
1. List your fears (rational and irrational)
2. Choose one fear you can safely approach
3. Photograph it or photograph yourself confronting it
4. Options:
   - If you fear heights: photograph from high place
   - If you fear aging: photograph aged face/body
   - If you fear judgment: photograph yourself vulnerably
5. Note your resistance and courage

**Reflection Questions:**
- How do your fears limit your photography?
- Which fears are protective? Which limiting?
- What becomes possible when you photograph what scares you?
- Can photography help you face fears?

**Going Deeper:**
Create courage series—document yourself doing things you fear. Evidence of bravery.

---

### Activity 23: Forgiveness and Letting Go

**Theory:**
Carrying resentment, regret, grudges weighs you down. Photography can be ritual of release—making image of what needs forgiveness, then releasing it (burning, burying, water release, etc.).

**Exercise:**
1. What needs forgiving? (You forgiving other, you forgiving yourself, or asking forgiveness)
2. Create photograph representing this situation
3. Write on back: "I forgive..." or "I ask forgiveness for..." or "I release..."
4. Perform release ritual:
   - Burn it safely
   - Bury it
   - Float it down stream
   - Or simply file it away as "complete"

**Reflection Questions:**
- What are you ready to release?
- What are you not ready to release?
- How does making image help letting go?
- What becomes available when you forgive?

**Going Deeper:**
Create series of everything you need to release. Visual inventory of burdens. Then release them all.

---

### Activity 24: Your Personal Mythology

**Theory:**
Everyone has personal mythology—stories you tell yourself about who you are, why things happen, what life means. These myths shape behavior. Photography can make myths visible and questionable.

**Exercise:**
1. Identify one story you tell about yourself
2. Examples: "I'm not creative," "I always fail at X," "I'm the strong one," "I'm unlucky," etc.
3. Ask: Is this myth true? Who benefits from this story?
4. Create photograph that:
   - Either reinforces myth (show it clearly), OR
   - Challenges myth (show opposite/complexity)
5. Which photograph feels more true?

**Reflection Questions:**
- What myths limit you?
- Where did these stories come from?
- What would change if you revised your mythology?
- Can photography write new story?

**Going Deeper:**
Create counter-mythology series—photographs proving your limiting stories wrong.

---

## MODULE 5: CREATIVITY AND EXPRESSION

### Activity 25: Your Creative Process

**Theory:**
Understanding how YOU create helps you create more. Everyone's process differs. Some plan meticulously. Some improvise wildly. Knowing your creative style helps you work with it rather than against it.

**Exercise:**
1. Document your complete creative process:
   - How do ideas come?
   - How do you prepare (or not)?
   - How do you work (fast/slow, planned/intuitive)?
   - How do you edit/refine?
   - How do you know when finished?
2. Create photo essay of your process
3. Identify your creative patterns

**Reflection Questions:**
- Do you plan or improvise?
- Do you work best alone or with others?
- What conditions help you create?
- What blocks your creativity?
- Is your current process serving you?

**Going Deeper:**
Try opposite process: If you plan, improvise. If you improvise, plan. Learn from contrast.

---

### Activity 26: Your Photographic Purpose

**Final Integration Activity**

**Theory:**
After 25 activities of self-exploration, you've gathered massive self-knowledge. This final activity synthesizes everything into clear photographic purpose. Who are you? What's your work? Why do you photograph?

**Exercise:**

**Part 1: Review**
- Look back through all 25 previous activities
- Note themes, patterns, revelations
- What did you learn about yourself?

**Part 2: Synthesis**
Answer these questions:
1. "I photograph because..."
2. "My photography serves..."
3. "Through my images, I want to..."
4. "My unique vision is..."
5. "In 10 years, I want my photography to have..."

**Part 3: Purpose Statement**
Write your photographic purpose (100-200 words):
- Who you are as photographer
- What you photograph and why
- What you hope your work does in world
- Your commitment to your practice

**Part 4: Purpose Portrait**
Create one photograph that embodies your purpose. This is your most important image—make it count.

**Final Reflection:**
- How has your photography changed through this course?
- How have YOU changed?
- What surprised you most?
- What will you continue exploring?
- How will you stay connected to your purpose?
