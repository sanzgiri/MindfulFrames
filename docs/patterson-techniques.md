## Photography and the Art of Seeing: Freeman Patterson's Techniques
### Visual Perception Workshop

---

## Introduction: Learning to See

Freeman Patterson's revolutionary approach to photography centers on one principle: **"Good seeing is the foundation of good photography."** This supplementary chapter provides his essential techniques for breaking free from habitual vision and developing true visual awareness.

**Core Philosophy:**
- Technique serves vision, not the reverse
- "Seeing" is different from "looking"
- Visual design principles exist to be understood, then transcended
- The photographer's most important tool is their mind
- Practice "thinking sideways" to escape visual clichés

---

## PART 1: BARRIERS TO SEEING

### Understanding What Blocks Vision

Before you can see clearly, you must recognize what prevents clear seeing:

**Barrier 1: Labels and Names**
- We see the word "tree" instead of the actual tree
- Names replace direct experience
- Exercise: Look at familiar object. What do you call it? Now forget the name. What remains?

**Barrier 2: Assumptions About Subject Matter**
- "Mountains are majestic" (really? always?)
- "Flowers are pretty" (but are they?)
- "Garbage is ugly" (what if it's not?)
- We photograph our assumptions, not what's there

**Barrier 3: Technical Obsession**
- Worrying about shutter speed instead of seeing
- Gear focus replaces visual focus
- Technique becomes barrier when it obscures subject

**Barrier 4: Fear of Judgment**
- "What will people think?"
- "Is this good enough?"
- "Am I doing it right?"
- Fear blocks authentic seeing

**Barrier 5: Speed and Distraction**
- Looking without seeing
- Moving too fast to notice
- Distracted mind misses everything

### Exercise: Breaking Through Barriers

**The Bathroom Exercise** (Patterson's Famous Challenge)
- Lock yourself in small room (bathroom perfect)
- Take 20 photographs in that limited space
- Rules: Can't leave, can't rearrange anything major
- Must find 20 different images
- "If you don't feel desperation before finishing, take another 20"

**Why it works:**
- Eliminates "I don't have good subjects" excuse
- Forces you past labels and assumptions
- Reveals that seeing is about you, not subjects
- Desperation breaks through habitual vision

**Variation: The Egg Exercise**
- Take 30 photographs of one hard-boiled egg
- No moving to exotic location
- Just you, egg, camera, light
- How many ways can you see one egg?

## PART 2: RELAXED ATTENTIVENESS

### The Core State for Photography

**What It Is:**
"Relaxed attentiveness" is alert presence without tension. Like cat watching mouse hole—absolutely present but not stressed. This state makes seeing possible.

**It's Not:**
- Passive daydreaming
- Aggressive hunting
- Tense concentration
- Distracted wandering

**It Is:**
- Soft-focused awareness
- Open receptivity
- Calm alertness
- Present without forcing

### Cultivating Relaxed Attentiveness

**Practice 1: The Soft Gaze**
- Don't focus on anything specifically
- Let eyes rest on middle distance
- Peripheral vision becomes as important as central
- Stay like this for 5 minutes
- Notice what appears without seeking

**Practice 2: Breath and Vision**
- Before raising camera, take 3 breaths
- Let shoulders drop
- Soften belly
- Eyes relax
- Now look—what do you see?

**Practice 3: Time in Nature**
- Sit in one outdoor spot 30 minutes
- Do nothing but be present
- Don't try to photograph
- Let relaxed attentiveness develop naturally
- Only then, consider photographing

### Exercise: Relaxed Seeing Walk
- Walk slowly in familiar place
- Soft gaze, relaxed body
- Stop when something calls you
- Don't question why—just stop
- Spend 3 minutes with what called you
- Then photograph (or don't)
- Continue walking in relaxed attentiveness

## PART 3: SUBJECT VS. SUBJECT MATTER

### Patterson's Essential Distinction

**Subject = The Thing**
- "This is a tree"
- "This is a person"
- "This is a building"
- The literal object

**Subject Matter = What You're Really Photographing**
- "This is loneliness" (person is just vehicle)
- "This is strength" (tree is just form)
- "This is geometry" (building is just structure)
- The actual content of your image

**Critical Understanding:**
- Subject matter can be communicated through many subjects
- Your real interest is subject matter, not subject
- This frees you to photograph anything to express what matters

### Examples:

**Subject Matter: Isolation**
- Could photograph: lone tree, single person, empty room, island
- Subject varies, subject matter stays same
- Choose best subject to express your subject matter

**Subject Matter: Connection**
- Could photograph: intertwined branches, holding hands, bridge, thread
- Again: different subjects, same subject matter

### Exercise: Separating Subject from Subject Matter

**Week 1: Choose Subject Matter**
- Pick abstract concept: "joy," "fragility," "strength," "change"
- This is your subject matter for the week

**Week 2: Find 10 Different Subjects**
- Photograph your subject matter using 10 completely different subjects
- If subject matter is "strength":
  - Old tree trunk
  - Athlete
  - Reinforced door
  - Mother with child
  - Mountain
  - Etc.

**Week 3: Reverse Engineer**
- Look at 10 of your favorite past images
- For each, ask: What was the subject?
- Then ask: What was the subject matter?
- Are they different? Should they be?

---

## PART 4: LEARNING TO OBSERVE (Rethinking the Familiar)

### Breaking Habitual Seeing

We stop seeing what we see every day. Patterson's techniques force fresh observation:

**Technique 1: New Perspective**
- Photograph ceiling instead of floor
- Shoot from ground level, not eye level
- Stand on chair and look down
- Look up always if you usually look straight

**Technique 2: Isolation**
- Take telephoto lens (or zoom)
- Isolate tiny portions of familiar scenes
- Abstract familiar into unfamiliar
- See patterns, not things

**Technique 3: Different Light**
- Photograph familiar place at opposite time
- Morning person? Go at night
- Night owl? Go at dawn
- Same place, different light = different place

**Technique 4: Seasonal Rotation**
- Choose one location
- Photograph it each season for a year
- Same composition, different seasons
- See how change reveals essence

### Exercise: The Familiar Made Strange

**30-Day Home Project**
- Photograph only inside your home
- 30 days, at least 5 images daily
- No shopping for new things
- No exotic angles (yet)
- First 10 days: Document everything
- Second 10 days: Get creative with angles
- Last 10 days: Pure abstraction
- By day 30, your home looks foreign

---

## PART 5: LEARNING TO IMAGINE (Abstracting and Selecting)

### From Documentation to Expression

Imagination in photography means selecting what serves your vision and abstracting what doesn't serve it.

**Abstraction Techniques:**

**1. Selective Focus**
- Throw background into blur
- Isolate subject from context
- Reduces image to essential form

**2. Extreme Cropping**
- Remove identifying features
- Show only pattern, shape, color
- Bark becomes abstract texture

**3. Motion Blur**
- Slow shutter speed
- Moving subject blurs
- Suggestion replaces documentation

**4. Multiple Exposure**
- Layer images
- Create impossible realities
- Imagination visible

**5. Unusual Framing**
- Cut off tops of heads
- Show only fragments
- Imply more than you show

### Exercises in Imagination

**Exercise 1: The Abstraction Series**
- Choose familiar subject (flower, building, face)
- Create 5 versions going from realistic to abstract:
  1. Straight documentation
  2. Simplified (selective focus)
  3. Pattern focus (closer)
  4. Texture only (very close)
  5. Pure abstraction (color/shape only)

**Exercise 2: Imagination Prompts**
- "What if this tree was an animal?"
- "How would I photograph this sound?"
- "Can I photograph wind?" (spoiler: yes)
- "What does Tuesday look like?"
- Impossible questions spark imagination

**Exercise 3: Pre-Visualization**
- Before raising camera, imagine finished image
- See it complete in your mind
- Then create what you imagined
- Develops imagination muscle

---

## PART 6: LEARNING TO EXPRESS (Connecting Inner and Outer)

### Photography as Personal Expression

Patterson emphasizes: "Technique without expression is empty. Expression without technique is impossible."

**Three Levels of Expression:**

**Level 1: Recording**
- "This is what it looked like"
- Documentation
- Necessary but not sufficient

**Level 2: Description**
- "This is how it felt"
- Beginning of expression
- Adds mood, emotion

**Level 3: Evocation**
- "This is what it means"
- True expression
- Viewer feels what you felt

### Finding Your Voice

**Question 1: What Draws You?**
- Notice: What do you photograph most?
- These subjects chosen for a reason
- The pattern reveals your voice

**Question 2: How Do You Feel?**
- Look at your images
- What emotion dominates?
- This emotion is part of your voice

**Question 3: What Matters to You?**
- What issues, themes, concerns appear?
- Social justice? Nature? Family? Solitude?
- Your values = your subject matter

### Exercise: Expression Development

**Week 1: Free Photography**
- Shoot anything, no restrictions
- 50+ images minimum
- Pure intuition

**Week 2: Pattern Recognition**
- Review week 1 images
- What themes appear?
- What drew you repeatedly?
- Make list of patterns

**Week 3: Conscious Expression**
- Now photograph your discovered themes deliberately
- Refine expression
- Develop your voice intentionally

---

## PART 7: THINKING SIDEWAYS

### Breaking Conventional Approaches

"Thinking sideways" means approaching problems from unexpected angles. Essential for creative photography.

**Linear Thinking (What Most Do):**
- "I want to photograph a mountain"
- Go to mountain
- Take photo of mountain
- Mountain looks like mountain

**Sideways Thinking:**
- "I want to express mountain-ness"
- What is essential about mountains?
- Height? Weight? Age? Permanence?
- How else could I show these qualities?
- Maybe photograph grain of sand (ancient, permanent, heavy, tall when magnified)

### Thinking Sideways Techniques

**Technique 1: Opposite Action**
- Want to photograph speed? Use 4-second exposure (blur = speed felt)
- Want to show crowds? Photograph empty space they left
- Want to show noise? Photograph silence
- Opposites reveal essence

**Technique 2: Wrong Tool**
- Use macro lens for landscapes (focus on tiny part)
- Use wide angle for portraits (environmental context)
- Use telephoto for street (compression, isolation)
- "Wrong" tools force sideways solutions

**Technique 3: Impossible Assignment**
- "Photograph love" (can't—it's abstract)
- Forces metaphor, symbol, suggestion
- Sideways thinking is only way

**Technique 4: Restrictions Breed Creativity**
- Can only photograph blue things today
- Can only make vertical images
- Can only shoot in first hour after waking
- Limits force sideways thinking

### Exercises in Sideways Thinking

**Exercise 1: The Opposite Gallery**
- Choose 5 concepts: Fast, Heavy, Soft, Chaos, Ancient
- Photograph each using its opposite:
  - Fast = long exposure stillness
  - Heavy = floating feather
  - Soft = sharp thorns
  - Chaos = precise order
  - Ancient = brand new baby
- Sideways thinking makes stronger images

**Exercise 2: Synesthesia Photography**
- Photograph sounds: "loud," "whisper," "crescendo"
- Photograph tastes: "bitter," "sweet," "umami"
- Photograph textures with different sense: "rough" as sound
- Crossing senses forces sideways thinking

**Exercise 3: The Translation Series**
- Read poem
- Translate into 5 photographs
- Can't illustrate literally
- Must think sideways to visual equivalent

---

## PART 8: ELEMENTS OF VISUAL DESIGN

### The Building Blocks

Patterson teaches traditional design elements—but to transcend them:

**Element 1: Line**
- Leads eye through image
- Creates movement
- Horizontal = calm
- Vertical = strength
- Diagonal = dynamic
- Curved = graceful

**Exercise:** Find and photograph 10 different types of lines in nature

**Element 2: Shape**
- Two-dimensional form
- Circle, square, triangle, organic
- Recognizable even as silhouette
- Strong shapes make strong images

**Exercise:** Create 5-image series based on one shape (circles, triangles, etc.)

**Element 3: Form**
- Three-dimensional shape
- Volume, mass, weight
- Revealed through light and shadow
- Gives photographs depth

**Exercise:** Photograph same object in 5 different lights to show form

**Element 4: Texture**
- Surface quality
- Rough, smooth, patterned
- Tactile visual experience
- Close-up technique essential

**Exercise:** Create texture library—photograph 30 different textures

**Element 5: Pattern**
- Repetition of elements
- Rhythm and predictability
- Breaking pattern adds interest
- Natural and human-made

**Exercise:** Find patterns in nature, patterns in city—10 each

**Element 6: Color**
- Emotional impact
- Complementary colors create tension
- Analogous colors create harmony
- Limited palette focuses image

**Exercise:** One-color day—photograph only red things (or blue, or yellow)

**Element 7: Tone**
- Lightness to darkness
- Contrast creates drama
- Subtle tones create mood
- Full tonal range usually strongest

**Exercise:** Create 5-image series from high-key (light) to low-key (dark)

---

## PART 9: PRINCIPLES OF VISUAL DESIGN

### How Elements Work Together

**Principle 1: Dominance**
- One element should dominate
- One color, one shape, one subject
- Avoids visual confusion
- Secondary elements support dominant

**Exercise:** Create image where color dominates, then line dominates, then texture—same scene

**Principle 2: Balance**
- Visual weight distributed
- Symmetrical balance = formal, stable
- Asymmetrical balance = dynamic, interesting
- Intentional imbalance = tension

**Exercise:** Make 3 versions: symmetrical, asymmetrical, intentionally unbalanced

**Principle 3: Proportion**
- Size relationships matter
- Golden ratio (1:1.618)
- Rule of thirds
- But: Know rules to break them effectively

**Exercise:** Create one "perfect" proportioned image, then deliberately violate proportions

**Principle 4: Rhythm**
- Repetition with variation
- Creates visual flow
- Leads eye through image
- Too much = boring, too little = chaotic

**Exercise:** Photograph rhythmic patterns—fence posts, windows, waves

**Principle 5: Unity**
- All parts work together
- Nothing feels random or out of place
- Coherent whole
- Difficult to achieve, worth pursuing

**Exercise:** Create triptych where all three images share unity of concept and design

---

## PART 10: BREAKING THE RULES SYSTEMATICALLY

### Advanced Techniques

Once you understand principles, deliberately violate them:

**Breaking Composition Rules:**

**1. Centering (Usually "Wrong")**
- Put subject dead center
- When it works: Symmetry, formal portraits, confrontational power
- Exercise: Create 10 powerful centered images

**2. Cutting Off Important Parts**
- Show half a face, part of car, edge of building
- When it works: Suggestion, mystery, pattern focus
- Exercise: Series of deliberate "bad" crops that work

**3. Extreme Angles**
- Shoot straight down, straight up, extreme diagonal
- When it works: Disorientation, fresh perspective, drama
- Exercise: No eye-level photographs for one day

**4. "Bad" Light**
- Harsh noon sun, flat overcast, mixed color temperatures
- When it works: Mood, documentary truth, contrast
- Exercise: Photograph only at "wrong" times of day

**5. Out of Focus**
- Deliberate blur, missed focus, soft images
- When it works: Emotion, dreamlike quality, essence over detail
- Exercise: Create sharp series, then blur series of same subjects

### The Meta-Rule

**Patterson's Ultimate Teaching:**
"The rules exist so you know what you're breaking and why."

- Ignorant rule-breaking = chaos
- Informed rule-breaking = art
- Learn deeply, then forget completely
- Trust your vision above all rules

## PART 12: EVALUATION AND GROWTH

### How to Assess Your Work

**Patterson's Self-Critique Method:**

**Question 1: What is this image about?**
- Can you name the subject matter?
- If not, image may lack clarity
- If yes, does image express it?

**Question 2: What works?**
- Identify strengths honestly
- These are your developing skills
- Build on what works

**Question 3: What doesn't work?**
- Be specific about weaknesses
- "I don't like it" is useless
- "The composition distracts from subject matter" is useful

**Question 4: What would I do differently?**
- Hypothetical improvement
- Actual learning happens here
- Apply to next photographs

**Question 5: What does this reveal about my vision?**
- What keeps appearing in my work?
- What am I trying to say?
- This is my emerging voice

### Keeping a Visual Journal

**Daily Practice:**
- Review day's photographs
- Write one paragraph per image:
  - What I intended
  - What happened
  - What I learned
- Track patterns over time

**Weekly Review:**
- Best image of week—why?
- Worst image—what happened?
- What improved since last week?
- What to focus on next week?

**Monthly Assessment:**
- Create best-of collection
- See progress over time
- Notice emerging themes
- Set goals for next month
