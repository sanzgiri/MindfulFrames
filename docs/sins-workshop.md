## SINS: A Photography Workshop for the Restless, Curious, and Unapologetically Sinful

### 8 Sessions Exploring Contemporary "Sins" Through Photography

---

## Workshop Overview

**Inspired by ANDANAfoto's SINS Workshop**

This provocative photography workshop invites you to question conventional morality and explore the "sins" of modern life through your lens. Are the seven deadly sins still relevant? What are the new sins of the 21st century? What does sin even mean when we've moved beyond religious frameworks?

**Structure:**
- 8 sessions over 4 weeks
- Each session: 15-20 minutes of content + photography exercise
- Includes reflection prompts, artist inspiration, and curated music
- Rooted in psychology and contemporary art

**Philosophy:**
This is not about religious sin or moral judgment. It's about examining behaviors, choices, and values through photography. What does society condemn? What do we condemn in ourselves? What deserves reconsideration?

**Who This Is For:**
- Restless photographers seeking edgier themes
- Those tired of "pretty" photography
- Anyone questioning social norms
- Curious minds attracted to shadow work
- Photographers wanting confrontational content

## SESSION 1: PRIDE

**The Sin:** Excessive self-regard, arrogance, vanity
**The Question:** Is pride always sin? What about self-respect, dignity, authenticity?
**Modern Context:** Selfie culture, personal branding, social media narcissism—or empowerment?

### Reflection (Read/Listen - 15 min)

**Traditional View:**
Pride is the deadliest sin—the root of all others. Thinking too highly of yourself, believing you're better than others, refusing to acknowledge limitations or dependence on others/God.

**Contemporary Question:**
But what about marginalized people finding pride? LGBTQ+ Pride parades. Black Pride. Women claiming space. Is self-love sin? When does healthy self-regard become destructive pride?

**Photography & Pride:**
Every photograph is an act of pride—"This is worth seeing," "My vision matters," "Look at what I saw." Is the act of photographing inherently proud? Should it be?

### Artist Inspiration: Cindy Sherman

Study her self-portraits—are they proud declarations of self or ironic commentaries on identity? Both? She transforms herself into hundreds of characters. Pride in performance or critique of vanity?

### Music Suggestion
*Search Spotify: confident music, empowerment anthems, "Vogue" by Madonna, "Formation" by Beyoncé, anything that embodies unapologetic pride*

### Photography Exercise: The Pride Project

**Assignment:**
Create a series of self-portraits that explore pride. Make them:
1. **Unapologetically Vain** - Your most beautiful/handsome self, no shame
2. **Proudly Authentic** - Exactly as you are, no filters, proud of truth
3. **Prideful Achievement** - You doing what you're proud of
4. **Excessive Pride** - Deliberately over-the-top, questioning where pride becomes too much
5. **Marginalized Pride** - If you're part of marginalized group, photograph your pride in that identity

**Reflection Questions:**
- When is pride positive?
- When does it harm?
- Are you proud enough of yourself?
- Where is your relationship with pride?

## SESSION 2: GREED

**The Sin:** Excessive desire for wealth, possessions, more than one needs
**The Question:** Is wanting more always wrong? What about ambition, aspiration?
**Modern Context:** Consumer culture, accumulation, economic inequality—or healthy goals?

### Reflection (15 min)

**Traditional View:**
Greed corrupts. More, more, more—never satisfied. Hoarding while others starve. Capitalism's engine is greed, and it destroys souls and planet.

**Contemporary Question:**
But isn't wanting better life reasonable? Is immigrant parent working three jobs greedy or ambitious? Is artist pursuing success greedy? Where's the line between enough and too much?

**Photography & Greed:**
We accumulate images like material goods. Thousands of photos never looked at. Do we photograph too much? Consume visual experience without digesting it? Is your hard drive full of greedy pixels?

### Artist Inspiration: Andreas Gursky

His large-scale photographs of consumer spaces—99 Cent Store, Amazon warehouse, stock exchange. Mountains of stuff, oceans of goods. Beautiful and horrifying.

### Music Suggestion
*Search Spotify: "Money" by Pink Floyd, "Material Girl" by Madonna, minimalist music as contrast, ambient music about emptiness*

### Photography Exercise: The Greed Inventory

**Assignment:**
1. **Your Accumulation** - Photograph all your possessions in one overwhelming image
2. **Store Anthropology** - Document consumer spaces (malls, stores, Amazon packages)
3. **The Minimalist Frame** - Photograph someone with almost nothing—dignity in simplicity
4. **Plenty & Scarcity** - Diptych showing excess next to lack
5. **Your Greed** - What do you want more of? Photograph your desire honestly

**Reflection Questions:**
- What do you have too much of?
- What do you not have enough of?
- Is your desire greed or legitimate need?
- How does consumer culture shape your photography?

## SESSION 3: LUST

**The Sin:** Excessive sexual desire, objectification, inappropriate passion
**The Question:** Is desire sin? What about passion, attraction, longing?
**Modern Context:** Sex positivity, consent culture, purity culture harm—reclaiming lust?

### Reflection (15 min)

**Traditional View:**
Lust destroys. It's about treating people as objects, not humans. Sexuality outside strict boundaries is dangerous and wrong. Body is shameful.

**Contemporary Question:**
But healthy sexuality is human. Desire is natural. Passion fuels art. Is the problem lust itself or lack of consent and respect? Can lust be sacred? Sex-positive feminism says yes.

**Photography & Lust:**
Every image involves desire—you desire to photograph, viewer desires to look. Gaze itself can be lustful (male gaze). But also: beauty, attraction, honest depiction of bodies and desire.

**Content Warning:** This session involves adult themes. Photograph tastefully and ethically. Never photograph anyone sexually without explicit consent.

### Artist Inspiration: Nan Goldin

"The Ballad of Sexual Dependency"—raw documentation of desire, relationships, sex, love, and pain. Lust shown honestly, not pornographically.

### Music Suggestion
*Search Spotify: "Closer" by Nine Inch Nails, "Wicked Game" by Chris Isaak, sensual jazz, music that captures longing*

### Photography Exercise: Desire Expressed

**Assignment (Choose appropriate ones for you):**
1. **Self-Portrait in Desire** - You as desiring subject, not object
2. **Implied Intimacy** - Intimate moment without explicit content (rumpled sheets, two coffee cups, intertwined hands)
3. **Beauty Honestly** - Photograph body (yours or willing subject) celebrating sensuality without objectification
4. **Longing** - Visual metaphor for desire (two objects almost touching, light reaching through window, shadow suggesting form)
5. **Desire for Non-Sexual Things** - Photograph your deepest non-sexual desire (for nature, art, connection, peace)

**Reflection Questions:**
- Is your desire healthy or harmful?
- Do you photograph ethically when desire is involved?
- Can you show beauty without objectification?
- Where do you stand on your own sensuality?

## SESSION 4: ENVY

**The Sin:** Resentment of others' good fortune, wanting what they have
**The Question:** Is comparison always destructive? What about motivation?
**Modern Context:** Social media envy, comparison culture, FOMO—or inspiration?

### Reflection (15 min)

**Traditional View:**
Envy poisons. Looking at neighbor's possessions/success with resentment. "Why them, not me?" Breeds bitterness and resentment instead of gratitude.

**Contemporary Question:**
But isn't comparison tool for growth? Seeing others' success can motivate. Admiration isn't envy. Instagram makes us all envious—but maybe it reveals what we truly want?

**Photography & Envy:**
Every photographer has looked at another's work with envy. "I wish I'd taken that." "Their gear is better." "They get all the recognition." Envy is occupational hazard. Can it be transmuted to inspiration?

### Artist Inspiration: Richard Avedon

Iconic fashion and portrait photographer. Do you envy his access, his subjects, his recognition? Can you learn from him without resentment?

### Music Suggestion
*Search Spotify: "Jealous" by Labrinth, "Jealousy" by Queen, music about longing, bittersweet melodies*

### Photography Exercise: Envy Examination

**Assignment:**
1. **What I Envy** - Photograph someone/something you envy (honestly)
2. **Whose Photography** - Study photographer you envy, create one image in their style
3. **Social Media Mirror** - Screenshot Instagram posts that trigger envy—what do they tell you about your desires?
4. **Gratitude Counter** - Photograph 10 things you have that others might envy
5. **Transformation** - Take envious feeling, channel it into creating your best work

**Reflection Questions:**
- Who do you envy? Why?
- What does your envy teach you about your values?
- Can you transmute envy into inspiration?
- What do you have that's enviable? (You do!)

## SESSION 5: GLUTTONY

**The Sin:** Excessive consumption, overindulgence, more than needed
**The Question:** What's wrong with pleasure and abundance?
**Modern Context:** Food culture, diet culture, feast and famine—what's healthy?

### Reflection (15 min)

**Traditional View:**
Gluttony is taking more than your share, consuming excessively, inability to practice restraint. Overindulgence in food, drink, any pleasure.

**Contemporary Question:**
But isn't abundance celebration? Shared meals are love. Food photography is art form. Is enjoying food gluttony? Or is problem food waste while others starve? Is it about amount or awareness?

**Photography & Gluttony:**
We consume images gluttonously. Endless scroll. Thousands of photos taken, barely seen. We gorge on visual stimulus. Are we gluttons of the eye?

### Artist Inspiration: Wolfgang Tillmans

His food photographs—simple meals, breakfast tables, half-eaten food. Ordinary consumption made visible, question what we consume and how.

### Music Suggestion
*Search Spotify: "Peaches" by The Presidents, "Cherry Pie" by Warrant, sensual food music, or minimalist music as contrast*

### Photography Exercise: Consumption Consciousness

**Assignment:**
1. **Abundance** - Photograph feast, plenty, overflowing table
2. **My Consumption** - Document everything you consume in one day (food, media, products)
3. **Waste** - Photograph what you waste (uneaten food, unused purchases)
4. **Simple Meal** - One beautiful image of modest, perfect meal
5. **Visual Gluttony** - Your photo library—how many unviewed images? Photograph the hard drive itself, questioning image gluttony

**Reflection Questions:**
- Do you consume too much? Too little?
- Where is your balance with food, media, images?
- Are you glutton of experiences, always consuming?
- Can you enjoy without overindulging?

## SESSION 6: WRATH

**The Sin:** Intense anger, rage, desire for vengeance
**The Question:** Is anger always destructive? What about righteous anger?
**Modern Context:** Rage at injustice, political anger, cancel culture—or necessary response?

### Reflection (15 min)

**Traditional View:**
Wrath destroys. Uncontrolled anger harms self and others. Vengeance is mine, says the Lord—not yours. Let go of anger, forgive, turn other cheek.

**Contemporary Question:**
But shouldn't injustice make us angry? Oppression demands rage. "Nice" people never change systems. Is wrath against evil righteous? Women told to smile, not rage—is that sin or social control?

**Photography & Wrath:**
Protest photography captures wrath. Documentary photography of injustice fueled by rage at suffering. Diane Arbus angry at exclusion. Sebastião Salgado angry at exploitation. Sometimes wrath creates greatest art.

### Artist Inspiration: Gordon Parks

Civil rights photography driven by righteous anger at racism. "Weapons of choice are cameras, not guns." Wrath channeled into social change.

### Music Suggestion
*Search Spotify: "Killing in the Name" by Rage Against the Machine, "Fight the Power" by Public Enemy, protest music, righteous anger*

### Photography Exercise: Rage as Fuel

**Assignment:**
1. **What Makes You Angry** - Document injustice you witness (ethically)
2. **Your Personal Rage** - Self-portrait expressing anger (safely)
3. **Righteous Wrath** - Photograph protest, resistance, people fighting for justice
4. **Aftermath of Anger** - What remains after rage passes? (broken things, exhaustion, or change?)
5. **Transforming Wrath** - Create beautiful image from angry place—channel rage constructively

**Reflection Questions:**
- What deserves your anger?
- How do you handle your rage?
- Is your anger productive or destructive?
- Can wrath fuel positive change through photography?

## SESSION 7: SLOTH

**The Sin:** Laziness, apathy, failure to use gifts
**The Question:** What about rest, contemplation, saying no?
**Modern Context:** Burnout culture, hustle culture, productivity obsession—is rest sin?

### Reflection (15 min)

**Traditional View:**
Sloth is wasting potential, failing to develop gifts God gave you, apathy toward good works. Lazy people don't fulfill purpose. Idleness is evil's workshop.

**Contemporary Question:**
But rest is resistance. Hustle culture kills. Doing nothing is radical act. Is contemplative life sloth? Saying "no" to maximize productivity—is that wise or sinful? What if slowing down is antidote to modern sickness?

**Photography & Sloth:**
Not photographing is okay. Staring at wall is part of creative process. Some photographers take one photo a year. Is that sloth or deliberation? Sometimes best photography comes from doing nothing first.

### Artist Inspiration: Sally Mann

Decades photographing same subjects (family, landscape). Slow, deliberate. Not prolific—purposeful. Opposite of hustle.

### Music Suggestion
*Search Spotify: "Lazy Sunday" by Small Faces, slow ambient, rest music, "4'33"" by John Cage (silence), meditation music*

### Photography Exercise: The Value of Stillness

**Assignment:**
1. **Doing Nothing** - Spend 2 hours doing absolutely nothing. Take ONE photograph at end
2. **Rest Portrait** - Photograph yourself or others resting, napping, being still
3. **Slowness** - One subject, photograph over entire day—no rushing
4. **Abandoned Projects** - Photograph your unfinished work—is it sloth or self-care?
5. **Permission to Pause** - Create series celebrating rest, saying no, slowing down

**Reflection Questions:**
- Are you slothful or exhausted?
- Do you rest enough? Too much?
- Is your "laziness" actually needed restoration?
- Can you give yourself permission to do nothing?

## FINAL REFLECTION: Beyond Sin

### The Meta-Question

Perhaps the real question isn't "What is sin?" but:
- Who decides what's sin?
- What purpose does concept of sin serve?
- How does fear of sin limit or liberate?
- Can photography free us from limiting beliefs?

### Your Relationship with Judgment

**Reflection Questions:**
- Do you judge yourself harshly?
- Do you photograph judgment (yours or others')?
- Can you make work without moral binary?
- Is anything actually sinful, or just human?

### Photography Ethics vs. Sin

**Consider:**
- Ethics ≠ Sin
- Ethics: Does this harm someone? (consent, dignity, truth)
- Sin: Does God/society disapprove?
- Your photography needs ethics, not sin concept

### Creating Your Own Values

**Final Exercise:**

Instead of avoiding sin, declare your values:

**My Photography Values:**
1. _______________ (e.g., "I photograph with consent")
2. _______________ (e.g., "I honor my subjects' dignity")
3. _______________ (e.g., "I make work that serves truth")
4. _______________ (e.g., "I photograph what matters to me")
5. _______________ (e.g., "I don't harm to make images")

These are YOUR values—not inherited sin concepts.

## FINAL THOUGHTS

This workshop isn't about encouraging actual harmful behavior. It's about:

**Questioning inherited beliefs**
**Examining what society condemns and why**
**Using photography to interrogate values**
**Finding authenticity beyond sin/virtue binary**
**Making work that's real, not safe**

You don't have to share SINS work publicly. This can be private inquiry. But by examining "sin" through photography, you:
- Confront your shadow
- Question limiting beliefs
- Make more authentic work
- Free yourself from unnecessary guilt
- Photograph more honestly

**The ultimate goal:** Photography that's true to who you are, not who you're supposed to be.
