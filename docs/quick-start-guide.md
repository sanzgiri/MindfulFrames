## WEEK 0: PREPARATION (Oct 15-24, 2025)

### Before the Course Starts

**Day 1-2: Mindset Preparation**

**Read This First:**
This is not about:
- ❌ Becoming a professional photographer
- ❌ Buying expensive equipment
- ❌ Taking "perfect" photos
- ❌ Posting to Instagram
- ❌ Impressing anyone

This IS about:
- ✅ Learning to see more clearly
- ✅ Being present in your life
- ✅ Using camera as meditation tool
- ✅ Discovering your unique vision
- ✅ Finding peace and awareness

**Set Your Intention:**
Complete this sentence and write it down:
"I'm starting this course because..."

Examples:
- "I want to slow down and notice my life more"
- "I feel disconnected and need a practice"
- "I love photography but lost joy in it"
- "I want to see Portland with fresh eyes"
- "I need a creative outlet that's just for me"

Your reason is valid. Write it down. Return to it when motivation wanes.

## COMMON FIRST WEEK CHALLENGES

### "I Don't Have Time!"

**Solutions:**
- Wake up 20 minutes earlier (yes, you can)
- Replace morning social media scroll with practice
- Weekend excursion is non-negotiable - protect it
- Remember: You're learning to be present in life you already have
- This practice SAVES time by making life more meaningful

**Minimum Viable Practice:** 10 minutes daily
- 5 min window meditation
- 5 min three photographs
- Even this is enough if consistent

---

### "My Photos Are Terrible!"

**Reality Check:**
- This isn't about good photos
- It's about practicing seeing
- "Terrible" photos teach as much as "good" ones
- You're a beginner - beginner work looks like beginner work
- That's normal and okay
- Keep going

**Reframe:**
- Instead of "good photo," ask "did I pay attention?"
- Instead of "Instagram-worthy," ask "did I notice something?"
- Instead of comparing to others, ask "am I growing?"

---

### "I Feel Silly/Self-Conscious"

**Normal!**
- Everyone feels this
- Photographing ordinary things feels weird at first
- Standing still in park feels awkward
- It passes with practice
- Your discomfort is ego resisting change
- Keep going anyway

**Helps:**
- Go early morning (fewer people)
- Remember: No one is watching
- Phone cameras are subtle
- You're allowed to photograph anything
- Your practice matters more than others' opinions

---

### "I Don't Feel Anything/See Anything Special"

**Also Normal!**
- Mindfulness is subtle
- Changes accumulate slowly
- You might not notice shifts until Week 4-6
- Trust the process
- Keep practicing even when it feels pointless
- The seeing develops quietly underneath

**Check:**
- Are you rushing? Slow down more.
- Are you judging? Let go of judgment.
- Are you comparing? Stop comparing.
- Are you present? Return to presence.

---

### "I Missed a Day (or Three)"

**It's Okay!**
- Don't quit because you missed days
- Just start again
- No guilt, no shame
- Consistency matters more than perfection
- Every day is new beginning

**Restart Protocol:**
1. Acknowledge gap without drama
2. Identify what blocked you (too ambitious? wrong time? external crisis?)
3. Adjust plan slightly
4. Begin again tomorrow
5. No starting over - pick up where you are

## FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS

**Q: Do I need to start on Oct 25?**
A: No, but starting with the group provides seasonal context and potential community. You can start any time and adapt seasonal references.

**Q: What if I can't do Portland locations?**
A: Adapt to your location. The principles work anywhere. Just find: daily nearby spot (your "Murrayhill Park"), weekly destination (your "Progress Ridge"), and occasional weekend locations.

**Q: Can I use filters/editing?**
A: Yes, but try shooting some images without editing. The practice is about seeing, not perfecting. Light editing okay, heavy manipulation moves away from mindfulness.

**Q: How do I know if I'm "doing it right"?**
A: Are you practicing regularly? Are you paying attention? Are you learning about yourself and your seeing? Then you're doing it right. There's no wrong way to practice presence.

**Q: Should I share my images publicly?**
A: Only if you want to. This practice is for you. Sharing is optional. Many students keep their work private. Others find sharing motivating. Your choice.

**Q: What if I can't afford the recommended books?**
A: Library! Portland Public Library has photography books. Also, the course materials you have are complete without buying anything else.

**Q: Can I do this with my phone camera?**
A: Yes! Phone cameras are excellent. Most professional photographers carry phones as backup. Camera matters far less than seeing.

**Q: Is this religious/spiritual?**
A: No religious affiliation required. Mindfulness has Buddhist roots but is practiced secularly. You can approach this as spiritual practice or simply as attention training. Your choice.
