# SUPPLEMENTARY CHAPTER
## I AM: Self-Portrait Workshop
### 15 Sessions on Photographing Yourself into Being

---

## Workshop Overview

**Duration:** 5 weeks, 3 sessions per week  
**Time per session:** 10-15 minutes contemplation + photography exercise  
**Format:** Audio reflection + photography prompt + music + artist inspiration  
**Philosophy:** The self-portrait is mirror and window—it shows you to yourself and reveals you to the world

**Core Question:** Who are you when you photograph yourself?

This workshop uses self-portraiture as tool for:
- Self-discovery
- Self-acceptance  
- Self-expression
- Transformation
- Integration of all parts of self

**No Experience Needed:** You don't need to be "photogenic." This isn't about beauty—it's about truth.

## SESSION 1: I AM MOVEMENT

### Theme: Your Body in Motion

**Reflection (Read/Listen - 10 min)**

You are never still. Even in sleep, you breathe, pulse, dream. Movement is life. Your particular way of moving is uniquely yours—the way you walk, gesture, turn your head.

When we photograph ourselves, we tend to freeze. Posed. Still. Rigid. But what if you photographed your movement instead? Your dance. Your flow. The energy that animates your body.

**Movement reveals:**
- Your vitality
- Your grace or awkwardness (both beautiful)
- Your relationship with your body
- How you take up space
- Your aliveness

**Questions to sit with:**
- How do you move through the world?
- Do you take up space freely or make yourself small?
- What does your movement reveal about your state of being?

### Music Suggestion
*Rhythmic, dance-able, anything that makes you want to move—from classical ballet to hip-hop to tribal drumming*

### Artist Inspiration: Francesca Woodman
Her blurred self-portraits captured movement—ghostly, floating, multiplied. She merged with spaces through motion.

### Photography Exercise: Self in Motion

**Assignment:**

Set up camera with self-timer or video mode (screenshot frames later)

**Option 1: Gesture Series**
- Take 10 images of yourself in motion
- Wave, reach, jump, turn, dance
- Use slow shutter speed for blur
- Celebrate your kinetic energy

**Option 2: Daily Movements**
- Document how you move through one day
- Getting out of bed, making coffee, walking, working
- Your particular choreography of life

**Option 3: Dance Portrait**
- Play music you love
- Dance freely
- Camera captures your movement
- No judgment—just energy

**Reflection:**
- What does your movement reveal?
- Do you move freely or restricted?
- What would change if you moved more authentically?

## SESSION 2: I AM BODY

### Theme: Your Physical Form

**Reflection (10 min)**

You live in a body. This particular body. Not the one you wish you had—this one. With its curves, angles, marks, scars, strengths, limitations. This body carries you through life.

Western culture teaches us to hate our bodies. Too fat, too thin, too dark, too light, too old, too marked, too something. Always too something. The self-portrait is act of reclaiming your body from this hatred.

**Your body is:**
- Home
- History (every mark tells story)
- Instrument
- Changing
- Worthy of being seen

**Questions to sit with:**
- What is your relationship with your body?
- What parts do you hide? Why?
- Can you photograph your body with compassion?

### Music Suggestion
*Grounding, earthy, embodied—think cello, bass, drums, anything that feels physical*

### Artist Inspiration: John Coplans
Photographed his aging body in fragments—powerful, honest, unashamed of age, wrinkles, sagging. Claimed his body.

### Photography Exercise: Body Inventory

**Assignment:**

**Option 1: Body Parts Series**
- Photograph 10 different parts of your body
- Close-ups, details, textures
- No face required
- Include parts you usually hide
- Find beauty in every part

**Option 2: Full Body Truth**
- One image of your complete body
- Unposed, natural, honest
- No manipulation, no "flattering" angles
- Just: This is my body

**Option 3: Body History**
- Photograph scars, marks, signs of your history
- Each mark has story
- Document your body's journey

**Reflection:**
- What surprised you about photographing your body?
- Can you see your body with compassion?
- What would change if you accepted your body as-is?

## SESSION 3: I AM SKIN

### Theme: Your Surface and Boundary

**Reflection (12 min)**

Skin is your boundary—where you end and world begins. It's your largest organ. It holds you together. It also shows your life: sun damage, age, emotion, health, heritage.

Your skin tone, texture, marks—these are political, personal, beautiful. In a world that judges skin harshly, photographing your own skin is radical act of self-acceptance.

**Skin shows:**
- Age
- Ancestry
- Experience
- Vulnerability
- Strength of boundary

**Questions to sit with:**
- How do you feel about your skin?
- What stories does it tell?
- Can you touch your own skin with tenderness?

### Music Suggestion
*Intimate, close, textural—think ambient, field recordings, gentle experimental*

### Artist Inspiration: Rotimi Fani-Kayode
Nigerian-British photographer who used self-portraiture to explore skin, race, sexuality, identity. Skin as political and beautiful.

### Photography Exercise: Skin Study

**Assignment:**

**Option 1: Macro Skin**
- Extreme close-ups of your skin
- Show texture, pores, marks, reality
- Find landscape in your skin

**Option 2: Light on Skin**
- How does light move across your skin?
- Photograph at different times of day
- See how skin changes in different light

**Option 3: Skin and Touch**
- Your hand touching your own face
- Self-touch as self-love
- Tenderness with your boundary

**Reflection:**
- What did you discover about your skin?
- Can you appreciate its texture, tone, history?
- What would change if you stopped judging your skin?

## SESSION 4: I AM EMOTION

### Theme: Feelings Made Visible

**Reflection (12 min)**

You feel constantly. Joy, sadness, anger, fear, peace, confusion—sometimes all at once. Usually we hide our true feelings. We perform acceptable emotions. Smile when we're sad. Act fine when we're not.

The self-portrait can be truth-telling. What if you showed what you actually feel? Not performed emotion—real feeling. This requires vulnerability. It also creates powerful images.

**Emotions are:**
- Valid (all of them)
- Information
- Energy moving through you
- Worth seeing
- Not permanent

**Questions to sit with:**
- What do you really feel right now?
- Which emotions do you allow? Which do you hide?
- Can you show authentic feeling in image?

### Music Suggestion
*Emotional range—from sad to ecstatic. Create playlist spanning all feelings.*

### Artist Inspiration: Nan Goldin
"The Ballad of Sexual Dependency" shows raw, honest emotion—joy, pain, love, despair, everything unfiltered.

### Photography Exercise: Emotional Truth

**Assignment:**

**Option 1: Seven Emotions**
- Create self-portrait for each: Joy, Sadness, Anger, Fear, Disgust, Surprise, Calm
- Don't perform—actually feel
- Let face show what's real

**Option 2: Right Now**
- Whatever you're feeling this moment
- Photograph it honestly
- No prettifying, no performing
- Just: This is what I feel

**Option 3: Emotional Landscape**
- Use light, color, composition to show emotion
- Don't rely on facial expression
- Let environment mirror feeling

**Reflection:**
- Which emotions were easy to show? Which difficult?
- What do you usually hide?
- What would change if you let yourself feel fully?

## SESSION 5: I AM WORDS

### Theme: Language and Identity

**Reflection (10 min)**

Words describe you: daughter, mother, worker, friend, artist. Also: anxious, creative, tired, hopeful. Some words are chosen. Some are imposed. Which words are truly yours?

You can also use words in your self-portraits. Text on body, words on paper, language integrated into image. What words name your truth?

**Words can:**
- Define
- Confine
- Liberate
- Transform
- Claim identity

**Questions to sit with:**
- What words describe you?
- Which words do you reject?
- What word would you write on your body?

### Music Suggestion
*Lyric-focused, poetry, spoken word, or silence to hear your own internal language*

### Artist Inspiration: Glenn Ligon
Uses text in self-portraiture to explore black identity, language, and meaning. Words become visual material.

### Photography Exercise: Textual Self

**Assignment:**

**Option 1: Word on Body**

- Examples: Enough, Survivor, Artist, Tired, Fierce, Tender

- Pages from book, text you've written, words on paper
- Which words live with you?

**Option 3: Name Study**

**Reflection:**
- What word feels most true?

- What would change if you renamed yourself?

## SESSION 6: I AM JOY

### Theme: What Delights You

**Reflection (10 min)**

When did you last feel pure joy? Not contentment or satisfaction—actual sparkling joy. Children feel it easily. Adults often forget how.

Your joy is valid. What makes you light up, laugh, feel alive—this matters. It's not frivolous. Joy is sustaining. Photograph yourself joyful. Give yourself permission to delight.

**Joy shows:**
- What matters to you
- Your aliveness
- Permission to feel good
- That life isn't all suffering
- Your capacity for pleasure

**Questions to sit with:**
- What actually brings you joy?
- Do you let yourself feel it fully?
- Can you photograph joy without performing happiness?

### Music Suggestion
*Whatever makes YOU joyful—could be death metal or Mozart, whatever sparks your joy*

### Artist Inspiration: Jacques Henri Lartigue
His early photographs radiate pure joy—childhood delight captured and sustained into adulthood.

### Photography Exercise: Joy Portrait

**Assignment:**

**Option 1: Doing Joy**
- Photograph yourself doing what brings real joy
- Reading, dancing, cooking, being with pet, whatever
- Catch genuine delight

**Option 2: Joy Face**
- Your true smile (not performed smile)
- The face you make when deeply happy
- No one watching—just you feeling good

**Option 3: Joy Environment**

- Nature, home, studio, wherever
- You + your happy place

**Reflection:**
- When did you last prioritize joy?
- Do you let yourself feel good?
- What would change if you chose joy more?

## SESSION 7: I AM STRENGTH

### Theme: Your Power

**Reflection (12 min)**

You are stronger than you know. You've survived everything so far. You carry resilience, power, capability. Society might not see your strength—especially if you're woman, person of color, queer, disabled, marginalized. But it's there.

Photograph your strength. Not performed toughness—real power. The strength that got you through hard times. The muscle and sinew. The endurance. The capacity.

**Strength is:**
- Surviving
- Holding boundaries
- Speaking truth
- Physical capability
- Emotional resilience
- Spiritual endurance

**Questions to sit with:**
- Where is your strength?
- Do you acknowledge your power?
- Can you photograph yourself powerful?

### Music Suggestion
*Powerful, anthem-like, anything that makes you feel your strength—from Aretha to Metallica*

### Artist Inspiration: Catherine Opie
Self-portraits showing strength, queerness, power. Reclaiming the gaze from those who would diminish.

**Reflection:**
- Do you own your strength?
- Where do you give your power away?
- What would change if you stood fully in your power?

---

## SESSION 8: I AM PAIN

### Theme: What Hurts

**Reflection (15 min)**

You've experienced pain. Physical, emotional, psychic. Everyone has. Usually we hide pain. We're supposed to be fine. Happy. Together. But pain is part of human experience.

Photographing your pain doesn't mean wallowing. It means witnessing. Acknowledging. "This hurt happened. I hurt. It matters." Sometimes showing pain begins healing.

**Pain can be:**
- Physical (chronic illness, injury, aging)
- Emotional (loss, trauma, grief)
- Existential (meaning crisis, despair)
- All valid
- All worth witnessing

**Content Warning:** This session may be difficult. Take care of yourself. Skip if needed.

### Music Suggestion
*Melancholic, mournful, or healing—requiems, blues, or silence*

### Artist Inspiration: Frida Kahlo
Self-portraits showing physical pain, emotional anguish, but also fierce survival and beauty-in-suffering.

### Photography Exercise: Pain Witnessed

- Who sees your pain? Who should?

## SESSION 9: I AM MYSTERY

### Theme: What's Unknown

**Reflection (12 min)**

You don't fully know yourself. Parts remain mysterious—even to you. Your subconscious, your deeper motivations, your unrealized potential, your shadow self. Mystery isn't failure—it's part of being human.

Can you photograph the unknown in yourself? The parts you can't name or explain? The mystery makes interesting art. Leave some things unexplained.

**Mystery includes:**
- Your depths
- Unconscious material
- Future self
- Hidden desires
- Shadow aspects
- What you can't articulate

**Questions to sit with:**
- What don't you know about yourself?
- Can you sit with not-knowing?
- What would mysterious self-portrait look like?

### Music Suggestion
*Enigmatic, ambient, experimental—music that suggests more than it states*

### Artist Inspiration: Francesca Woodman
Her self-portraits are mysterious—blurred, hidden, partially visible. Never fully revealed.

### Photography Exercise: Unknown Self

**Assignment:**

**Option 1: Obscured Portrait**
- Photograph yourself but hide something
- Face in shadow, body blurred, partial view

## SESSION 10: I AM TRIBE

### Theme: Who You Belong To

**Reflection (10 min)**

You're not alone. You belong to people—family (chosen or biological), friends, community, ancestors, those yet to come. Your identity is partly collective. Who is your tribe?

Can you photograph yourself in relationship? With your people? As part of something larger? Connection is part of who you are.

**Tribe includes:**
- Family
- Friends
- Community
- Ancestors
- Those who share your identity
- Those who love you

**Questions to sit with:**

---

## SESSION 11: I AM GAZE

### Theme: How You Look

**Reflection (12 min)**

Your gaze is unique. The way you look at world. Your particular perspective. Your lens. When you photograph yourself, you're both subject and seer—you control the gaze for once.

Usually others look at you. Especially if you're woman, queer, person of color, disabled—always being looked at, judged, assessed. Self-portrait reclaims the gaze. You decide how you're seen.

**Your gaze:**
- Is your perspective
- Can be reclaimed
- Sees what others miss
- Is political act
- Is your power

**Questions to sit with:**
- How do you look at the world?
- How do you want to be looked at?
- Can you photograph the looker (you)?

### Music Suggestion
*Music about seeing, perception, vision—maybe Brian Eno, maybe meditative*

### Artist Inspiration: Laura Aguilar
Chicana photographer whose self-portraits reclaim gaze from white supremacy, fatphobia, heteronormativity. She looks back.

### Photography Exercise: The Looker

**Assignment:**

**Option 1: Looking Out**
- Photograph yourself in act of looking
- At window, through camera, gazing at something
- The seer seeing

**Option 2: Direct Gaze**
- Look straight at camera
- Unflinching, direct, claiming
- You looking back at viewer

**Option 3: Gaze Diary**
- Document what you look at for one day
- Your gaze patterns
- Then: Self-portrait of the person who sees these things

**Reflection:**
- How do you look at the world?
- Do you let yourself look?
- What would change if you claimed your gaze fully?

---

## SESSION 12: I AM WHAT I IMAGINE

### Theme: Your Interior World

**Reflection (10 min)**

Your imagination is rich. You daydream, fantasize, envision futures, replay pasts. Your interior world is as real as exterior. Can you photograph what you imagine?

This is where surrealism helps. Self-portrait doesn't have to be documentary. It can show your dreams, fears, fantasies, impossible selves. Your imagination made visible.

**Imagination includes:**
- Dreams
- Fantasies
- Fears
- Hopes
- Alternate selves
- Impossible scenarios

**Questions to sit with:**
- Who are you in your imagination?
- What do you daydream about?
- Can you photograph impossible self?

- Different location, different self, different reality
- What if?

**Reflection:**
- Who are you in your imagination?
- What does imagination tell you about desires?
- What would change if you let imagination guide you more?

---

## SESSION 13: I AM SHADOW AND REFLECTION

### Theme: The Double

**Reflection (12 min)**

You cast shadow. You appear in reflections. These are your doubles—attached but separate. Shadow represents unconscious, hidden self. Reflection shows how you appear to others. Both are you and not-you.

Playing with shadow and reflection in self-portrait creates doubling—the seen and unseen, the light and dark, the surface and depth.

**Shadow/Reflection reveals:**
- Duality
- Hidden self
- Surface vs depth
- Light and dark
- Inside and outside

**Questions to sit with:**
- What does your shadow hold?
- How does your reflection differ from your self-perception?
- Can you photograph both light and shadow?

### Music Suggestion
*Dual, contrasting, music about duality and shadow*

### Artist Inspiration: Bill Brandt
Used dramatic shadows in portraiture, showing shadow as essential part of person.

### Photography Exercise: Double Self

**Assignment:**

**Option 1: Shadow Portrait**
- You + your shadow
- Give shadow equal importance
- Two selves in one image

**Option 2: Reflection Self**
- You in mirror, window, water
- Real you and reflected you
- Which is more real?

**Option 3: Light and Shadow**
- Half your face in light, half in shadow
- The duality within
- Both parts necessary

**Reflection:**
- What does your shadow hold?
- Can you integrate light and shadow?
- What would change if you accepted your whole self?

---

## SESSION 14: I AM TIME

### Theme: Your Temporality

**Reflection (12 min)**

You exist in time. You were younger once. You'll be older. Right now is fleeting. Your body shows time—aging, changing, carrying your history forward. You're also atemporal—something in you doesn't age.

Time in self-portraiture can be linear (documenting aging) or layered (past/present/future in one image). How do you photograph your relationship with time?

**Time shows:**
- Aging
- Change
- History
- Mortality
- Continuity
- The eternal now

**Questions to sit with:**
- How do you feel about aging?
- What does time show on your body?
- Can you photograph yourself across time?

### Music Suggestion
*Temporal, cyclic, music about time passing or stopping*

### Artist Inspiration: Nicholas Nixon
"The Brown Sisters"—photographed four sisters every year for 40+ years. Time made visible.

### Photography Exercise: Temporal Self

**Assignment:**

**Option 1: Then and Now**
- Recreate old photograph of yourself
- Same pose, years later
- Time's passage visible

**Option 2: Aging Series**
- If you have photos from different ages, create sequence
- Or photograph yourself now + imagine future self (draw/collage it)
- Your timeline

**Option 3: Timeless Self**
- Photograph the part of you that doesn't age
- Your essence, your spirit
- Beyond time

**Reflection:**
- How do you feel about your aging?
- What changes? What stays same?
- What would change if you made peace with time?

---

## SESSION 15: I AM RARITY

### Theme: Your Uniqueness

**Reflection (15 min)**

There's never been another you. Never will be. Your exact combination of genetics, experiences, thoughts, feelings, perspective—unique. Rare. Irreplaceable. You're not one in a million. You're one of one.

This final self-portrait celebrates your rarity. Everything you've explored—movement, body, skin, emotion, words, joy, strength, pain, mystery, tribe, gaze, imagination, shadow, time—combine into unrepeatable you.

**Your rarity is:**
- Your specific body
- Your particular history
- Your unique perspective
- Your irreplaceable voice
- Your singular existence

**Questions to sit with:**
- Do you appreciate your uniqueness?
- What makes you rare?
- Can you photograph yourself as the one-of-one you are?

### Music Suggestion
*Celebratory, affirming, music that says YES to existence*

### Artist Inspiration: Self-portrait artists collectively
Every self-portrait artist says: "I matter. My particular existence deserves witnessing."

### Photography Exercise: I Am

**Final Assignment:**

**Integration Portrait**
- Create self-portrait that integrates everything
- All aspects of self
- All you've learned
- Your complete, complex, rare self
- No more hiding, performing, or diminishing
- Just: I AM

**Variations:**
- Could be face
- Could be body
- Could be environment
- Could be abstract
- Whatever shows your complete self

### Final Reflection:
- Who are you after 15 sessions?
- What did you discover?
- Can you see yourself with compassion?
- How will you continue witnessing yourself?

## FAQ: Self-Portrait Practice

**Q: Do I have to show my face?**
A: No. Body parts, shadows, abstractions, implied presence all count as self-portrait.

**Q: What if I hate how I look?**
A: This workshop helps with that. Self-portraiture can heal relationship with your appearance.

**Q: Is this narcissistic?**
A: Self-witnessing isn't narcissism. It's self-knowledge. You matter. Your existence deserves documentation.

**Q: Can I use filters/editing?**
A: Your choice. But try some totally unedited. Truth has power.

**Q: What if someone sees these?**
A: You control who sees. These can stay private. Or you can share selectively.

**Q: How often should I do this?**
A: As often as feels right. Weekly? Monthly? When struggling? Follow your needs.

*"The camera is an excuse to be someplace you otherwise don't belong. It gives me both a point of connection and a point of separation."* — Susan Meiselas

**In self-portraiture, the place you don't belong but get to visit is: yourself.**

**You belong to yourself. Fully. Finally.**

**I AM.** 

*Now show us who that is.*
